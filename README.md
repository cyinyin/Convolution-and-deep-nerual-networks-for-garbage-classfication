# Convolution-and-deep-nerual-networks-for-garbage-classfication

The classification treatment of garbage plays a vital role in environmental quality. Traditional garbage classification relies on manpower, and its  speed and accuracy decrease with time, and improper classification will cause harm to the human body. In response to this problem, this article developed an intelligent garbage classification system. The system use a 4-layer Convolutional neural network for local feature extraction and learning, and use a 5-layer fully connected network for overall feature learning and classification, and use the Dropout regularization to optimize the network. Compared with other systems, this system has fewer neural network layers and run faster. The system has been trained on image dataset provided by Gary Thung and Mindy Yang, and has reached a higher accuracy.
